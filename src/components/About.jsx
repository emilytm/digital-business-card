            <p className="about--content">I am a frontend engineer with 7 years of product management and product design experience. My skills and expertise in PM and design make me a unique candidate for frontend engineering roles. I have the strategic and organizational skills of a product manager, the creativity and research experience of a designer, and now the skills of a frontend engineer. I know what makes frontend engineers especially great - both output and how best to work with other disciplines - and I am eager to prove it.</p>
