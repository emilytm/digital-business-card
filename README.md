# digital-business-card

This digital business card was created as a step in the 'React Basics' module of the Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path. The goal was to build a basic React app to solidify our understanding of components and how to use them. This was my first React project. Design and functionality requirements are from Scrimba.

**Next steps:** Look for ways to make this useful 🤷‍♀️
